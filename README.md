# **LaTeX Diagram & File Generators**

**Type:** Utility / Archive · **Tech Stack:** LaTeX, TikZ · **Status:** Active

## **Overview**

An evolving archive of **LaTeX/TikZ-based generators and animations** for producing mathematical and diagrammatic illustrations. Designed for flexibility and reuse, each script can generate ready-to-compile `.tex` files for inclusion in research papers, visual explanations, and academic notes.

## **Current Files**

* **`conformal_mappings_animation.tex`** — Generates an animated TikZ illustration of conformal transformations.
* **`differential_field_generator.tex`** — Produces differential field diagrams for vector and gradient visualisation.

## **Features**

* **Reproducible Diagrams:** Generates deterministic visuals suitable for academic use.
* **TikZ Automation:** Complex geometry and animation commands parameterised for easy reuse.
* **Extensible Library:** More scripts (e.g. phase portraits, geometric constructions, flow fields) will be added over time.
* **Academic Integration:** Each file compiles independently and can be embedded directly into LaTeX projects.

## **Purpose**

Created as a **personal archive** for reusable mathematical visuals and algorithmic diagram generation, combining LaTeX precision with programmatic control for reproducible and elegant outputs.
